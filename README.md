Wumpus_World
==============

Hunt the Wumpus is an early video game where the player navigates a cave in search for gold avoiding dangerous monsters (Wumpus) and bottomless pits. In modern studies of intelligent systems, this world is very often modeled using various programming languages where the computer tries to intelligently find gold without being killed. This is my implementation of a Wumpus World solution in C++ programming language.

Requirements
------------

* Any standard C++ library and compiler.

Instructions for a Linux based operating system
----------------------------------------------

First, make sure you have the C++ library and G++ compiler installed. If you're using a Ubuntu based Linux distribution you can use the following command to install required tools:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential

Now you can get the latest package, unpack it and compile the code using the following commands:

    wget -c https://github.com/chanmj96/Wumpus_World/archive/master.zip && unzip master.zip
    cd Wumpus_World-master
    make
    cd bin
    ./MyAI


Final Note
----------
In cases where gold is unreachable to the player, computer moves back to starting position avoiding loss of more points. This strategy maintains a high average score which you can see with the following command:
    
    Navigate to the Wumpus_World-master directory
    make score
